A fellow traveller asking questions, finding answers and sharing them with anyone who cares to listen.

Earlier this year, when I gave in to my internal nudges, I set out on a spiritual path that has led me to an awakening and an understanding beyond my wildest imagination.

I am a seeker, someone with the deep desire to learn the truth about things. And the more I learn the more my world as I know it unravels.

My absolute favourite thing in the world is learning and writing stuff that comes from my soul.

This blog and everything I do is about helping you to remember the truth of who you are, so that from that place of remembrance, you can live a truly joyous, meaningful and fulfilling life. So that from that place of remembrance, you can take back your power from those who have benefited from keeping you in the dark and step fully into freedom and live upon the earth as the person God intends for you to be.

It is from this place of authenticity alone that our soul evolves, expands and blossoms into its natural state of love and connectedness with the divine.

When, through what I write about, say or do, you get a glimpse into this authentic powerful version of you, I get to fulfil my purpose for being here and get to enjoy the immense joy that comes from that knowledge.

It is the dawn of a new earth, the beginning of a new era. The old things of poverty, greed, hatred, racism, and anger will make way for the new; abundance, contentment, love, unity, oneness, joy and a sense of global community. And this is not my hopeless optimism speaking. Indeed, a fifth dimensional earth is emerging out of all this chaos.

I’m happy to play my little part in this by sharing my knowledge with you. Together with you, we can help anchor the light of heaven on earth for this massive shift to happen.

If anything on this site resonates with you, I hope that you will share it with others. Let’s get the word out.

I write about spirituality, esoteric sciences, mysticism, psychology with a sprinkle of cosmology and energy healing.

I hope you find the answers you are seeking and the peace that comes with it.

Salaam!
