I created and run Infinitude.

Infinitude is about helping you remember the truth of who you are, so that from that place of remembrance, you can live a truly joyous, meaningful and fulfilling life; you can step fully into freedom and live upon the earth as the person God intends for you to be.

It is from this place of authenticity alone that our soul evolves, expands and blossoms into its natural state of love and connectedness with the divine.

When through what you read, listen to or watch on the Infinitude platforms, you get a glimpse into this authentic powerful version of you, I get to fulfil my purpose for being here and get to enjoy the immense joy that comes with that.

It is the dawn of a new earth, the beginning of a new era. The old things of poverty, greed, hatred, racism, and anger will make way for the new; abundance, contentment, love, unity, oneness, joy and a sense of global community. And this is not my hopeless optimism speaking. Indeed, fifth-dimensional earth is emerging out of all this chaos.

I’m happy to play my little part in this by sharing my knowledge with you. Together with you, we can help anchor the light of heaven on earth for this massive shift to happen.

If anything on this site resonates with you, I hope that you will share it with others. Let’s get the word out.

I hope you find the answers you are seeking and the peace that comes with it.

Salaam!
