So, this is how it is, you've created a self-concept of yourself based upon how you were conditioned as a child, this self-concept forms the basis for your human identity.

You think you are this identity and this identity is you so much so that you become delirious with anger when is self-concept is threatened.

Throughout history, we've seen how men have killed for the sake of ethnicity, honour, religion and many other manifestations of this identity. Even today many people are willing to kill if this identity is threatened in some way.

This is the depths of the conditioning. It shows how far man has separated from his true essence of love.

The thing is, the more you're mired and ingrained in your worldly identity, the less and less you remember who you truly are.

This false identity you ascribed does not even begin to scratch the surface of who you truly are.

**_The life of this world is a game. You are a character in a play. You are playing a role that's meant to help you grow into love._**

But you mistake the character for the player. You think you're this-worldly identity, but this worldly identity is only an experience you are having, one out of many.

You see, the life of this world is a pilgrimage to the great light that lies within; your mighty God presence, your true nature of love, peace and light.

**_This world is a contrasting environment for the soul._**

The little human identity is a contrast to the vastness of the soul. The fear, shackles and darkness of the little human identity is a contrast to the love, freedom and the light of the soul.

_Frustration is a contrast to The Peace of the soul._

_Anger is a contrast to the compassion of the soul._

_Lack is a contrast to the abundance of the soul._

And in this realm of contrast, where the soul experiences everything that it is not, and by the force of the unpleasantness of being who it is not, and by the guidance of its emotional guidance system, the soul is meant to remember the truth of who it is.

But you've become lost in the worldly game. You looked right at the contrast and decided this is all there is, this shitty life, that's all there is and you set to survive no matter what within the constraints.

**You've never gone within for guidance and answers because no one taught you how, and because you do not go within, you have to go without.**

You stopped growing in love and instead started to grow in fear. "I have to keep safe you said, I have to survive, " forgetting that you can do much more than surviving, you can thrive.

You forgot that whatever happens in this realm of physicality cannot in any real sense harm the essence that you are.

Fear keeps you imprisoned. Fear keeps your soul stagnant. Fear keeps you focused on the outside and the outside world can do very little for you because it is a mirror of your internal state. As within so without.

You have to break free. There's no better time for it.

**Within you is a fountain of infinite calm and peace, peace that is unfazed by outside conditions. It is a fountain of infinite love, peace and connectedness to the Source of all there is.**

The life of this world is meant to guide you to that place.

When you are tapped into this fountain, you have the peace of God that transcends all understanding. You become more grounded into yourself, more loving, more compassionate, kinder, more generous, you become God-like in your attributes. You step fully into your power.

This is your divine destiny and if it will take you hundreds of lifetimes this is where you must arrive, for the destiny of every soul is to return to its creator, the destiny of the essence is to merge with the source in a state of purity, sparkling in the light of its understanding, devoid of any dark emotions, intentions and inclinations.

This is the time to start your journey back, you've been in this game for too long.

It's time to get unstuck and you can begin right now. Go inward and God bless you.
