What is the purpose of life? What are we trying to achieve here?

If you’ve been following the series up until this point, then you know already that life is a game and the whole point of the game is for you to learn, and to awaken to the reality of who you are within the game. 

You are here to learn how to be an embodiment of love; to learn how to overcome and transcend anything and everything that stands in your way of achieving this reality.

Basically, you are here to become God-like; to purify your soul and your energy to be deserving of a permanent place with God.

And since this mighty challenge cannot possibly be achieved within a single lifetime, you come here many times to keep going with the lessons.

When from the spirit side, you look upon a lifetime that you’re coming into, from that vantage point, the challenges look really small. And that is because you have your **emotional guidance system** and many other forms of guidance.

Today, I’m going to be looking at the emotional guidance system and how understanding it can give you a big edge in this game of life.

### **The Purpose of Emotions**

Emotions when looked at from a higher perspective are neither good nor bad. Both negative and positive emotions have their purposes. 

Emotions are messengers; signposts or you can even call them signals. They are there to show you when you’re getting on track or off track in your journey.

At any point in time, there’s a stream of well-being flowing towards us during our life here on earth. This stream of well-being is the life force, the spirit of God.

When we are allowing the flow of this well-being into our lives, we feel joy, peace and happiness, abundance, ease and grace. When we are blocking the flow, our emotions indicate to us that this is happening. We feel sadness, anger, frustration, lack, and other forms of negativity.

When we are positive, our vibrational frequency is high; our state of being is going in the direction that aligns with our natural state of being.

When we are negative, we are dimming our light; our vibrational frequency is low and we are taking the opposite direction of where our soul wants to be headed. And so we feel bad.

**_This is the spiritual purpose of emotions. They show us when we are on or off track._**

### **Processing Negative emotions**

Negative emotions are meant to be observed and released. 

Just like any other thing in the universe, emotions are energy. When we feel them and we don’t release them, they get stored in our psyche as trauma and wreak havoc in our lives over a long period.

It is unfortunate that in our society, we are taught to suppress emotions. Children are told not to cry, outburst of any type is frowned upon. This has led to generations and generations of us carrying baggage from one life into the next.

The things that trigger us continuously in our adult life are usually unprocessed emotions saved in our body as dark energy that keeps coming up again and again.

They keep getting triggered because our body is calling attention to them to be released.

Negative emotions stored in the body block the free flow of life force in our bodies. They prevent well-being from flowing freely into our lives. This right here is the cause of every sickness that manifests itself in the physical body.

## **Thoughts creates emotions**

Emotions whether positive or negative are superseded by thoughts and our thoughts arise out of our perception and interpretation of the reality around us.

**Thought is the way our brain tries to make sense of the world.**

The outside world itself and whatever is happening in it has absolutely no control over your state of being, this is what you must understand. 

It is how you perceive events and in turn, think about them that affect you. Negative emotions will always follow a certain pattern of thoughts, and so does positive emotions.

Since our perceptions are created based on our beliefs and conditioning, it so follows that our thoughts result from the same. In most cases, how we interpret events is not based on absolute or universal truths, it is based on our own individual truths born out of social conditioning.

**One example that comes to mind is death.**

In many cultures around the world, death is not considered a bad thing; it is just a natural process, much like breathing. Life is celebrated and death is accepted without negativity. 

Compare this with other parts where death is considered a tragedy of the highest proportion and so results in much grief and sadness.

If you find yourself in a negative state of mind, check the thoughts that lead to it. If you can change the thought immediately to something better, your emotions will follow suit.

If you’re finding it difficult to change the thought, perhaps you want to have a look at the belief or perception that results in that thought. You can reprogram your subconscious with thoughts that empower you, rather than put you down. I talked about it [here.]()

The easiest way to start working with your emotions is to learn to get back in touch with the wisdom of your body.

### **Practice body awareness**

Learn to listen to what your body is trying to tell you at any point in time. On waking up every morning, take your attention to your inner body. With your awareness, scan from head to toe gently moving from part to part. 

Notice any area that feels dense or uncomfortable. Shine the light of your awareness into these areas by focusing fully on them and breathing into them. This is easy, just breathe in but direct the flow of the breath into the area in focus. 

Have an intention to release any energetic blocks preventing your life force from flowing freely. Do this every day upon waking.

### **Release Negative emotions as they arise**

Our default mode of response to triggers is to indulge them fully. We let them control us because we usually think the person who caused the trigger to come up deserved a piece of our madness. 

But you are not doing anyone any good by indulging in this. 

Sometimes, the people who trigger us the most are there to help us to learn a certain lesson. They are actually our friends on the spirit side who have volunteered in this lifetime to be our greatest pain in order for us to learn the lessons we came here to learn.

To win this game of life, you need to understand that the things that trigger you are not as a result of anything anybody does to you or any event that happens outside of you. It is as a result of the energetic blocks you carry within your psyche that prevents you from embodying your true essence of divine unconditional love.

You must understand that you, the awareness that provides a space for all of your experiences to happen is greater than any trauma stored in your body. And you are in charge and in control.

Whenever you feel triggered, take a deep breath, notice how you feel and allow yourself to feel it fully. Shout and scream if you must (preferably not at anyone, smiles). Then gently allow the dark energy to pass. Just breathe in and with each breath, imagine this dark cloud passing away. Imagine the light getting brighter.

In the cases when you feel triggered and you can localise the energy somewhere in your body; that is an indication that is an old emotion stored. 

Many people feel a constriction in their throats or tightness in their chest. It could be anywhere. For example, anxiety usually manifests in the third energy centre, just below the chest.

When this is the case, it might take a while to release this old emotion, you need to be consistent in catching the emotions when they arise and go through the steps above. 

If you will want to clear your blocks much faster, you can use a technique like EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) to take quantum steps in this process. 

The more you clear your energetic blocks, the more peaceful you become on the inside, the more life becomes effortless, the more ease and grace flows to you, the more abundance flows to you, the more joyful you are, the more in alignment you are.

A lot can transform in your life within a short period if you can allow yourself to heal. Life was never meant to be miserable. The misery and suffering comes from our state of non-allowance; a state where we dwell in negative emotions and disallow the flow of well-being into our lives.

I wish you luck in your healing
