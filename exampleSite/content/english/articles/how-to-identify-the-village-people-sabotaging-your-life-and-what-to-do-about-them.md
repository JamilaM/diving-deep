Village people - they’re the bane of your existence, aren’t they?

You work so hard but progress is evasive. Trying to get ahead in life feels like sailing against the tide, it’s so unbelievably hard.

Then, just when you start to make progress; when it’s obvious that your hard work is about to pay off and your life is about to change for the better, boom! Everything comes crashing down like a pile of poorly arranged cartons.

And just like that, you are back to square one.

It is not funny and it is not nice.

It’s a curse, you conclude, it must be. Village people will not let you be.

Village people would make you believe that your life is destined to be mediocre, that your faith is in the hands of forces beyond your control.

You pray really hard; you go for deliverance; you give yourself sleepless nights for some breakthrough and when all else fails, you swear and curse, yet, nothing seems to be working.

It’s frustrating, like hair-pulling, mind-jarring frustrating.

I feel you. Together, we are going to get to the bottom of this issue.

In order to solve a problem, first, you must understand it thoroughly.

And so we are going to begin by understanding exactly who your own specific village people are and what they got on you.

Then and only then can we launch an offensive.

### **Who are these village people?**

Village people as I understand them and use them in this post are a personification of everything that sabotages us on our path of progress, forces that hinder our growth.

But here’s the shocker and perhaps something you are not expecting at all, they are not real people and they do not exist outside of you.

They are deep within, locked behind the trapped door of your subconscious mind (the village), where they are gently exerting control on your every action, every thought without you ever knowing they are there.

_They are so powerful that most of what we do and what we fail to do is dictated by them._

**Your individual village people are the limiting and self-sabotaging believes and subconscious programming that you harbour within that affect your reality.**

### **How do your subconscious village people affect your reality?**

The subconscious mind is a **repository** of the beliefs that control our realities, but most times, we are not even aware of what is up there. This is because most of the subconscious beliefs we have were formed during the most vulnerable stages of our lives, between the ages of 1 to 7 or during our most relaxing and suggestible stages, when we are not aware of what is happening.

Yet, they control most of our decision in our adult life.

Seems unfair, you might say. But unfortunately, that's the reality we have to deal with.

Reality is subjective and a very individual thing because none of us has exactly the same set of beliefs, or from the spiritual perspective, none of us gives off the same vibrational offering.

We are each transmitting this vibrational offering and receiving their out-picturing into our realities.

You must understand, belief is a powerful force. **What you believe in just works for you, positively or negatively. They are the strong force behind your truths.**

We are creative beings; the universe is moulding itself to fit into our worldview. Everyone has his own truth and each truth seems to be valid according to his own experiences.

This is why the most unempowering thing you can do to yourself is to limit yourself based on what you perceive to be other people's truth. Why not create your own instead? Instead of taking on other people's limiting beliefs, why not program your subconscious with empowering ones?

**Everything is possible, EVERYTHING. That's if you can find a way to summon the right beliefs.**

From an outward perspective, beliefs can freeze you from taking action or propel you forward.

If for example, you believe that you need to work very hard to make money or to be deserving of your income, you'll see people investing in opportunities and making money while they sleep, but you will not take the steps to do the same, even though you're exhausted and you need the money, and on a conscious level, you even admire the soft lifestyle.

And here's the most unfortunate thing. Even if you summon up the courage to invest, it will flop. Because there's a contradiction. You're putting off the signal that says "**_I must work hard to make money, easy money is not good money_**".

That signal is going to bring to you exactly the same set of experiences that match it. You're like a radio receiver. You get what you put out.

If you want the experience to change, you must change the subconscious programming. Change the signal.

All this might sound gloomy but here's the good news.

If everything that is holding you back from living the life of your dreams exists within you and is not some unseen, unknown outside force controlling you, then surely you can change things.

You can clear your sabotaging beliefs and reprogram your subconscious mind with new empowering ones that will propel you forward towards the life you've always dreamt of.

You can get rid of your village people, or at least the ones you don't like.

And when next you hear "village people this, village people that", you can smile to yourself in the knowledge that you've conquered your own.

**But how? I know you're asking**

There are so many modalities available. I'll list here only the ones I've tried:

#### **Meditation**

To use meditation to clear subconscious blocks, you need to be able to identify the blocks. Then in a meditative state, you get into your subconscious mind and delete the beliefs and replace them with new empowering ones. Poof! just like that, they are gone.

You only need to do this once for any set of limiting beliefs. I recommend working with a set of three at a time.

You need to get comfortable with meditating first before trying this technique. 

**If you're the type you practices mindfulness meditation, you can include this at the end of your session when you're still in the meditative state:**

_Imagine yourself going up a staircase into a room. In the room there's a table and a chair with a computer on the table._

_Get familiar with the environment. Notice the colour of the computer and the chair and the table. Don't worry if you think you're making things up, that's how it works._

_Sit on the chair. Imagine there's a button that brings up your limiting beliefs and another button that deletes and another button that saves. See these buttons clearly in your mind's eye._

_Now, click on the scan button to bring up the specific limiting beliefs you want to work on. See them clearly written on the screen. Delete them._ 

_Replace them with empowering ones. See the new empowering beliefs written clearly on the screen. Click on the Save button._

_Gently stand up from the chair and leave the room. Come down the stairs._

_You can now open your eyes._

**An example of how you can switch from limiting beliefs to empowering ones:**

**_From_**_: Money is scarce - **To**: Money is all around me_

**_From:_** _Life is hard - **To**: Life is exciting_

**_From_**_: People are wicked - **To**: Deep down everyone is good. I chose to go beyond the superficial and see the good in all._

**_Warning: Don’t do this just before you go to bed, you’ll sleep light and fitful because your brain hardware will upgrade itself according to your new programming._**

#### **Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)**

EFT is a very powerful healing modality. It requires you to be able to feel your fear and hesitations or whatever emotion is holding you back, and then, you use the feeling as a guide to clear the energetic blocks.

It uses a mixture of acupuncture, Neuro-linguistic programming and psychology to access your energy body and subconscious mind. 

The idea is for you to tap on specific meridians on your body while focusing on the emotions you're feeling and to vocalise the things your mind is telling you about the situation.

This stuff is unbelievably powerful. I've cleared an insane amount of limiting blocks and trauma in such a short period of time with this technique.

#### **Breathwork**

The breath is so simple, yet so profound. When you combine breathing with your awareness, you start to get out of the hypnotic zombie mode that you've living your entire life. 

The advantage of using Breathwork is that you don’t need to identify the specific blocks, but you need to make an intention to clear blocks that are stopping you from doing something you really want to do.

The idea here is to use certain breathing techniques to move energy around or outside of your body. In this case, what you're moving are the energetic blocks hindering your progress. 

**A simple one to do:**

_Sit in a quiet place with your back erect, make sure you won't be disturbed for at least 10 minutes. Make an intention for whatever blocks you want to work on (if you don't have anything specific in mind, go general)._

_Take a deep breath at the same time squeeze the lower part of your torso (from your perineum to the sacral area, just at the base of your breastbone. As you squeeze, imagine that your spine is a tube, and energy is moving from that tube to the top of your head._

_As you breathe, suck this energy to the top of your head. When you feel the energy is there, hold while keeping your attention at the top of your head for at least one minute._ 

_Breath out and relax. Repeat several times._

**_Note: At the beginning, you probably will not feel the energy moving and that is fine. That doesn't mean nothing is happening. Just trust the process._**

#### **Affirmations**

With affirmations, you identify the version of yourself that you want to be, you then create positive affirmations that you repeat to yourself when you are at your most suggestible states. I utilise my mornings immediately after opening my eyes from sleep. At this time, the brain is still in the Alpha level of consciousness and whatever you say to yourself goes straight into your subconscious mind.

The key with affirmations is you need to believe what you’re saying, put meaning behind the words. This might be difficult for a lot of people, especially if you don’t yet feel like the person you want to be.

But you have to understand that everything that you’ve ever wanted and the person you want to be, all already exist in an endless sea of possibilities that is the universe. There’s no past, there’s no future. Everything exists right now. Time is just a filter, an illusion created by our minds to be able to live in this dimension. When you align your energy with a certain reality, the reality shows up in your life. It already exists, everything already exists.

Affirmation is a way for you to align your energy with the new reality. You are not deceiving yourself; you are drawing something that already exists into your reality.

Some examples of powerful affirmations:

* _I am smart_
* _I am powerful_
* _I am abundant_
* _I am loved_
* _I am taken care of_
* _I am joyful_

***

Take whichever technique resonates best with you. Combine techniques for speedy progress. And show up and do the work. The new version of you that is unlimited and unhindered is not going to show up when you’re thinking and doing the same thing over and over again.

I wish you luck.
