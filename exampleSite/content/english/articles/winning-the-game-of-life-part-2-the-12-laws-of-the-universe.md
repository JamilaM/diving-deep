In part one of this series, I spoke about the nature of reality and how our lives here on earth can be likened to a game simulation.

Today, I’m going to talk about the 12 laws of the universe that will enable you to master this life and make the most of the opportunity it provides, in love, peace and joy.

The 12 Laws of the universe are the laws by which the universe operates. They are the same no matter where you go in the universe; no matter the planet you are and no matter the dimension of time and space that you find yourself in.

Understanding the 12 laws of the universe will help you to start living life as your soulful self rather than the egoic self that we are all conditioned to be.

Let's dive right in.

### **1. The Law of Divine Oneness**

This is the foundational law of the universe and it is also known as the law of one; it states that:

**_“We are all connected to one source, made of the same thing. We are like an interconnected web of energy, and everything we do sends vibrations throughout the entire web, affecting the collective consciousness.”_**

In other words, we all came from the same Source and even in our physical state are all connected to Source and to each other. And as a result, every word you say, every choice you make, all your beliefs, actions, thoughts and feelings affect you, others, the collective and the universe itself.

This is because the universe is a network or matrix of interconnected particles. Whatever we do affects the universe in some way. For example, every thought conceived get released into the vast endless pool of energy that is the universe and remains there, changing the very arrangement of the particles. 

Another way to understand this law is to know that there’s only just one consciousness and each of us is individualisation and localisation of this one consciousness. Also, everything in the universe is made up of the energy of The One, and so you see, The One is really all there is.

**How you can practice this law in your daily life:**

Try to see yourself as part of others and also a part of the divine. Have compassion for others. Because whatever you do to others, you do to yourself.

### **2. The Law of Vibration**

This law states that:

**_“Everything in the universe is energy vibrating, from your body to your thoughts to your emotions. Love is of the highest vibration and hate is the densest and base vibration”._**

In other words, at a microscopic level, everything is in a constant state of motion, nothing ever rest, which is good news or bad, depending on where you’re coming from. It means we can raise our energy and vibrational frequency in order to live a joyful and peaceful life or lower it and become miserable.

**How to apply this law in your daily life:**

Understand that high energy particles are naturally attuned to particles of their likeness and vice versa. How you vibrate is what the universe echoes back to you at any point. You are like a radio transmitter and receiver. You get what you put out.

Make a commitment to raise your vibrational frequency and make it a habit to always return to this heightened frequency, no matter what. For example, if you’re always grateful, which is a very high vibrational frequency, the universe will send to you more things to be grateful for. If on the other hand, you’re always miserable and complaining, the universe which does not discriminate, will honour your request and give you what matches your vibrational offering.

### **3. Law of Correspondence**

This law states that:

**_“Your outer world is always a reflection of your inner world. As above, so below; as within, so without. “_**

In other words, our reality is a reflection of what is going on inside of us. You see, your reality is not The Reality, it is just the one you are tuned into by virtue of your beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and actions. 

If your life is chaotic and fearful, It is because there is chaos and fear inside of you. If your life is peaceful and calm, it is because you feel peace and calm on the inside.

**How to apply this law in your daily life**: 

Take dominion over your life and understand that life is not happening to you, you are happening to life. Heal everything in you that you don’t want reflecting in your reality. Reprogram your mind with empowering beliefs and thoughts and watch how your life rearranges itself to fit into this new version of you.

### **4. The law of attraction**

This law state that:

**_“The level of your vibration attracts circumstances, experiences and people of a like vibration.”_**

In other words, like attract like. You attract the same things, people, events and emotions that vibrate on the same level as you do. You get what you focus on all the time. 

This is the law of vibration in action. 

If you spend most of your time focusing on what you don’t want, that is what will continue to show up in your life. If you’re spending most of your time judging others, criticising, or complaining about things, that is the signal you are radiating into the universe, and you attract the same thing.

**How to apply this in your daily life:**

Take charge of your thoughts, emotions, beliefs and actions. Instead of complaining about situations you don’t like, ask yourself, what do I have within me that is attracting this event? Find whatever it is and change it.

If for example, you are always broke and worrying about money, it’s very possible you have a lot of unhelpful beliefs about money which makes you and money not to be a vibrational match. As a result, you can’t seem to attract enough of it, and even when you do, you can’t seem to keep it. You have to change your beliefs, and your reality will reflect the change.

### **5. Law of inspired action**

This law state that:

**_“Action taken from an inspired, high-vibrational place will yield tremendous results compared to action taken from a place of struggle and low vibration.”_**

This law goes hand in hand with the law of attraction; it means you have to take inspired action towards the things you want. As you start to align your thoughts, emotions and beliefs towards the kind of life you want, believe me you’ll be led to take the action that will get you there. 

This will manifest as gentle but persistent internal nudges steering you towards a certain action.

**How to apply this law to your daily life:**

Be sure the actions you are taking are not coming from the place of frustration and struggle. Try to use the law of attraction to align your vibration with what you want. Be grateful for it as though it’s already here. 

Have a positive outlook and expectations. Use visualisations and vision boards if you’re so inclined. And then pay attention to the actions you’re inspired to take and make sure you listen.

### **6. Law of perpetual transmutation of energy**

This law state that:

**_“High vibration can cause a positive change in low vibration”_**

Since everything in the universe is in constant flux - changing at the cellular, molecular and atomic levels - it’s very easy to trigger positive change in your life using this law. Even a very small action can trigger profound results in the direction of your heart desires.

**How to apply this law in your daily life**:

When you feel low and are vibrating at a low frequency, expose yourself to high vibrational things or situations with the intention of transmuting the negative energy holding you in a low vibration. 

For example, you can listen to music that makes you happy or visit an infectiously happy friend that always seems to lift your spirit.

You can also directly transmute negative energy with your own high vibration, in other words, you can help transmute some of the darkness in this world into light. 

Always share positivity, love, inspiration, joy and peace, not their negative counterparts. Nothing good ever comes out of sharing and distributing darkness.

### **7. The law of cause and effect**

This is also known as the law of Karma and it is the easiest law to understand. It states that:

**_“Action equals reaction. What you put out comes back to you in equal measure.”_**

In other words, what goes around comes around. This is how the universe maintains balance.

Nothing in this life happens by chance, it is all a reflection of where you have been mentally and emotionally whether in this life or the past. Your beliefs, thoughts, choices, actions and decisions are not just affecting you but affecting everything and everyone around you.

**How to apply this law in your daily life:**

Be very mindful of what you put out. Don’t give others what you don’t want to receive. Don’t treat others the way you will not like to be treated. If you put out anger, hate and negativity, it will come right back to bite you. Love others, have compassion and dismiss every tendency to judge. The more love and kindness you put out, the more you’ll receive. It is law.

### **8. The law of compensation**

This law state that:

**_“ The law of cause and effect is applied to our abundance”_**

In order words, you will receive compensation for the work or service you deliver to others as long as you’re open to receiving it in all the many ways that the universe can deliver”

This is the basis for the adage, you reap what you sow.

Compensation here is not limited to financial payment; it’s payment in many different ways for the contributions you make to the world, including the positivity, joy and love that you spread around.

How to apply this law:

Serve the world in whatever small way you can. Allow others to serve you.

Be a benefit to others and allow yourself to benefit from others. Put yourself in a space of giving and receiving. If there is an imbalance between the two in your life, for example, you give so much but received little or none in return, then this is only happening because there’s something in you that is blocking your ability to receive, perhaps something like a deep-seated feeling of unworthiness that must be cured.

### **9. The Law of Relativity**

This law states that:

**_“Everything is neutral in isolation. Nothing is good or bad until it is compared to something else”._**

In other words, no person, emotions, thing, action, experience is good or bad until it is compared to something else. There is more than one perspective on any given situation and ultimately we are the ones who assign meanings to events.

**How to apply this law to your life:**

You have the power to assign meaning to anything happening in your life. No matter how challenging or undesirable a situation might look, you can choose to see things from the perspective of them always happening in your favour. 

This is an empowering perspective. Ultimately, life is happening for you, not against you, and you can use every situation as feedback that steers you towards the direction you want to go.

### **10. The law of Polarity**

This law states that:

**_“Everything in the universe has a polar opposite. There are two sides of everything on the same spectrum.”_**

In other ways, where there’s light, there must be darkness. Where there’s good, there must be evil. One cannot exist without the other, for without the polarity, you can only know things conceptually, not experientially. 

For example, you only know what cold feels like because you’ve experienced warmth.

**How to apply this law in your life:**

Experiencing polarity is part of the human experience. It is what makes us identify our preferences and desires and what to focus and channel our energy into.

If you’re experiencing something in your life that you do not want, think of its opposite. Then focus your energy and attention on bringing that opposite reality into being. Dwelling on things you do not want only fuels them and perpetuate them in your experience.

### **11. The law of rhythm (AKA law of perpetual motion)**

This law state that:

**_“Everything happens in cycles. Things ebb and flow and are in constant movement and change”_**

In other words, change is a natural progression of life, you can see it in the seasons and in our natural birth and death cycles. Nothing ever stays the same no matter how hard you try.

**How to apply this in your life:**

When things are going well in our lives, we expect it to remain the same, but this is not only unnatural and unrealistic; it is a recipe for unhappiness. 

Embrace the cycles in your life because they are inevitable. There will be the growth phase and there will be the integration phase. Go with the flow. When things are not happening the way you want them to, understand the importance that kind of phase and then use it as a propeller for the next phase in your life.

### **12. Law of Gender (Giving and receiving)**

This law states that:

**_“There are two primal forces in the universe which is contained in all things; the masculine and feminine energy, the yin and the yang. These energies must be in balance."_**

Yin and Yang must not be confused with the biological sex. Each of us is an embodiment of the divine masculine and feminine energies, as is every other thing. To live authentically and happily, these energies must be in balance.

Part of the reason why there’s so much struggle and hardship in the world is that there’s an imbalance of the divine feminine and masculine. Historically, the world has operated principally from the masculine energies and there has been generations of the suppression of the feminine energy. 

For there to be harmony in our world, there needs to be a balance between the divine masculine traits of logic, reason, action, firmness, survival, loyalty, adventurousness, strength, and rationality, and the divine Feminine traits of intuition, nurturing healing, gentleness, expression, wisdom, patience, emotions, and flexibility.

**How to apply this law in your daily life:**

Have a look at your life and reflect upon where the energies are unbalanced. Where there’s too much masculine action or hustle, you need to bring in more feminine rest and time to just be, where there’s so much masculine logic, make room for more feminine intuition and where there’s too much masculine rigidity, make room for more feminine flexibility.

And there we have it.

Mastering the 12 laws of the universe is one way to master your life and start living more authentically and happily as your soulful self. 

Let me know in the comments how you intend to use these laws in your life at present.

You are love and you are loved, always.

Peace!
