We are all familiar to some degree that the housekeeping of our bodies occurs during sleep; restoring balance, filtering toxins. Our brains rewire and organise the inputs we’ve fed into it during our wakeful state.

But is that all there is to it?

If our bodies go through housekeeping, what happens to consciousness and what is the connection between what happens to it and what happens to our bodies during sleep?

Many people believe that we lose consciousness when we sleep, yet we all look forward to having a good night of sleep. How can we look forward to our own annihilation?

Consciousness is who we are; to lose consciousness will mean to seize to exist, and that’s a cosmic impossibility.

**As such, sleep is not the loss of, but the journeying of consciousness into other dimensions.**

Earth is multi-dimensional. The universe is multi-dimensional. What we see, hear feel, touch, taste during our wakeful state is just one of its dimensions - one that does not even begin to scratch the surface in this vast and endless universe.

We are also multi-dimensional beings; at any given time, the consciousness that we are exists in many dimensions, but we are only focused on and aware of one at a time. During our wakeful state when we are in embodiment, the dimension we are aware of is the physical plane of earth.

_For the purpose of understanding, let’s look at the levels of consciousness:_

* Beta
* Alpha
* Theta
* Delta
* Gamma

Depending on the time of the day and what we happen to be doing, the consciousness that we are exists in one of the above levels. Every day, we transition from one level into another depending on what we are doing.

**At Beta**, we’re fully awake to the outside world and our focus is on the outside. We are not sleeping. We are highly alert and going about our daily activities. Beta is further subdivided into 3 levels, which I won’t go into in this article.

**At Alpha**, we are awake too, but in a relaxed and highly suggestible state. Our attention is not focused on the outside but on the inside. This stage usually corresponds to when we’re imagining or daydreaming.

At that twilight moment when we’re just about to fall asleep, our brain enters **Theta**, which is also associated with light sleep and the dream stage.

During deep restorative sleep, we enter into the **Delta** level of consciousness.

The level of consciousness that we are in determines which dimension we are in and what we see and experience. Now, let's go back to the topic of sleep.

### I will begin with the dreams

We all dream, every single one of us. The only difference is, some remember theirs and some don’t. When we dream, our brain is in the theta frequency and the consciousness that we are is in and interacting with another dimension.

You might say, but dreams happen because our subconscious mind or our brain is processing stuff, and that is correct. That is what is happening to our physical body.

Science is just now trying to understand that it is consciousness that dictates what happens to the physical body and not the other way round. There’s an intelligence that guides our bodily functions, one that restores, repairs, rejuvenates and arranges.

You could say, the consciousness that we are, is somewhere in the universe, interacting with another dimension, and whatever it is doing is having an impact on our physical body.

In the dream realm, we are not constraint by the restrictions of being in our bodies, and so we can do things like fly, levitate, we can be in different places at the same time, we can jump from one location to another instantly.

Even time as we know it behaves differently in this realm. Sometimes, we see people who are dead and interact with them, because death is just a passing into another realm or dimension, not the end of consciousness. We can also interact with the souls of other people who we know or might not know during our wakeful states.

Some dreams are coded messages from the other side; our higher self, our past or future selves or from the universe.

Pay particular attention to dreams that elicit feelings in you, strong or otherwise. These are the meaningful ones.

### Deep Sleep

During deep restorative sleep, our brainwave shows delta frequency which indicates that the consciousness that we are, is at that level. We usually cannot remember anything at all from this stage of sleep, but we awake from it feeling happy, energised, refreshed and restored.

We quite literally just got a boost from the universe to continue our earthly sojourn happy and motivated.

Deep sleep is so critical to our wellbeing, so critical that it cannot be overemphasized. This is because it is at this stage that we return to our natural, pure and original state of oneness and connectedness with Source.

It’s not that we can’t remember anything; it is that we remember nothing. We become nobody, just pure consciousness. There is nothing from an outward perspective, and so our brain cannot out-picture anything for us when we are waking up, as is the case with dreams. There are no thoughts, no perceptions, no problems, just the feeling of pure unadulterated bliss.

And so we wake up with that glow and joy and clarity. And the only thing we know is that we slept well.

This is why, whenever you’re not able to sleep deep as a result of one thing or the other, you wake up tired, grumpy, and irritable. After days of not sleeping deep, you feel drained, miserable and possibly depressed.

Your body becomes weaker and weaker, your immune system suffers.

To exist in this plain, we rely heavily on these daily trips to the divine oneness, where we can be who we truly are, unencumbered by the realities of our present wakeful life.

You must understand that life on earth is not easy on the soul; embodiment is not easy on the soul.

There’s this metaphor I once read that does justice to this.

Imagine yourself now, the way you are in your body, as big as you are, imagine being compressed into a seasoning cube and this seasoning cube becomes your new body that you have to use to navigate the earth. How hard will that be for you?

Yet that is similar to what the soul is doing in embodiment. We go from being limitless, weightless beings enjoying a state of unending bliss to being bound in matter and experiencing the struggles that characterise human life on earth.

This is why babies (new incarnating souls) sleep all the time. To survive, they need to continuously go back to their natural state of remembrance until they adjust to being in embodiment.

But I must tell you, it is a worthy sacrifice. There’s no better way for the soul to quickly evolve than being in embodiment and living this life. It’s all for a good cause.

In conclusion, I’d say, take your return journey every night with all seriousness; it is a very spiritual endeavour. Also, always remember that you are not alone, we are never alone. We never have been, never will be.

There’s the loving presence of God available to us at all times. Quiet your mind, open up your heart and tune in. Soon, I’ll write about how you can do this so that you can start to receive more of this love. Stay tuned and subscribe.
